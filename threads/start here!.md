### Welcome to *hypothesize*!

*hypothesize* is a minimalist application for note-taking and document management that is designed to be highly flexible and easy to navigate. Getting started is easy:

As in a wiki, ((hypothesize tutorial - threads|threads)) (files like this one you're reading right now) and ((hypothesize tutorial - documents|documents)) (published journal articles and the like) are connected together through hyperlinks. The previous sentence, for example, contains links to two different threads. If you click on them, they'll open inline with the current thread.

You can also link to documents. For example, here is a link to the [[Hypothesize2016|license]] for this software.   If you open this link and click on "Hypothesize2016" you'll be taken to the pdf that was uploaded along with this document. 

When editing a thread, links to other threads or documents are referenced using a special syntax. Thread links are surrounded by double parentheses and document links by double square brackets. If you edit this thread, you'll see how the above links were specified. For more advanced syntax ((hypothesize tutorial - syntax|click here)).
